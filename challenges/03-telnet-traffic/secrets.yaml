  - "Telnet is severely outdated and sends all traffic unencrypted. A malicious user might get access to usernames, passwords and all commands run on the server as well as their output. It is even possible to hijack your connection and make request as if they came from your client."
  - "ARP poisoning sends fake ARP packets that link the victims IP address to the attackers MAC address in order to fill up the ARP cache of other systems in the network. Other systems will now route all packets to his MAC address when trying to communicate with the target. This way the attacker can sit in the middle and inspect all packets before sending them on their original way."
