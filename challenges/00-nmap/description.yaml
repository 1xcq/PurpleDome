name: "Scan your targets"
description: |
  This first challenge serves as an introduction to some basic scans on your targets with "nmap".
  Make sure nmap is installed on your system.

  After starting the machine try to scan the network it is supposed to be in.
  You can do that by specifying the address and a subnet mask. (For example: "nmap 192.168.56.0/24")

  Another option you might have is to interact with a system using its hostname. (In this case: "nmap target1.local")

  It is possible that nmap tells you that the host seems down. Check it with the "ping" command.
  In such a case you may use the option "-Pn" with nmap. Do some research on what it does.

  After checking out the open services experiment a bit with additional nmap scans. 

  > Find out how to scan for the operating system of a target.
  > How do can you change the timing of the scans?
  > Try to do version detection on the open ports.
  > Is there an option to combine all those scans?
quiz_questions:
  - "What is the most aggressive timing nmap may use?"
  - "How many ports are open, how many closed?"
  - "What does it mean when a port is filtered?"
  - "What does the qotd service do?"

    content: "The flag can be found with a specific nmap scan."
