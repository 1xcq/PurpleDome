name: "Guess my credentials"

  I prepared a presentation for a group project today and forgot my credentials to log in. Can you help me bruteforce the way into the system?

  I can't remember the main user but I know the machine has a user named 'test' that is accessible over ssh and has a password somehow related to the name.
  If you successfully log in with that one you might find the actual username.
  I picked my password randomly from some list on the internet that had lots of very secure passwords!
