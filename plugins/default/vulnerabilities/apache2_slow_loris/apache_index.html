    <h1>Denial-of-Service</h1>
    <p>
        Denial of Service (DoS) is a form of attack where the attacker tries to overload systems to the point they are temporarily unusable or crash.
        This often involves spamming a server with requests and take up enough resources until it is not able to function anymore.
        Other forms of DoS exploit bugs in how systems handle requests. Smartly constructed network packets might crash vulnerable systems.
