# Filebeat plugin

Basic demo plugin for a linux filebeat sensor.

## Important feature

The sensor demos a feature to create config files based on a template before the file is deployed to the target.


## Current state

Basic functionality is working. The logging is not optimized. Will come back to it as soon as we have more attacks.
