## PurpleDome Research

Spin up a virtual environment and run automated attacks in there, log traces, create detection, countermeasures, mitigations and harden your systems. This is the core of PurpleDome. 

PurpleDome is a platform for IT security research. This page is to collect all PurpleDome based research projects. Finished and ongoing ones. And to allow everyone to benefit from them, contribute or connect to them.
